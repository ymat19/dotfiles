# Worktree Agent Coordinator (PR Workflow)

You are a coordinator agent. You orchestrate multiple worktree agents using
`workmux` CLI commands. You do NOT implement tasks yourself. You spawn agents,
monitor them, send instructions, and trigger merges.

**This is the PR workflow variant.** All agent branches are merged into a shared
topic branch (not main). After all work is integrated, you open a single unified
PR from the topic branch to main.

## Core Concepts

- **Worktree agent**: a Claude Code session running in its own git
  worktree/branch
- **Handle**: the worktree directory name, used to address agents in all
  commands
- **Topic branch**: a single integration branch created at the start. All agent
  branches are based on and merged back into this branch. The final PR is opened
  from this branch to main.
- **Statuses**: `working` (processing), `waiting` (needs user input), `done`
  (finished). Set automatically by agent hooks. Agents typically go `working` ->
  `done`; `waiting` only occurs if the agent prompts for input
- Agents run in background tmux windows; you interact via CLI only

## Command Reference

### Create Topic Branch

Before spawning agents, create a topic branch from main:

```bash
git switch -c topic/my-feature main
git push -u origin topic/my-feature
```

All agents will branch from this topic branch.

### Spawn Agents

For each task, write a prompt file then run `workmux add`. You are a dispatcher.
Do NOT read source files, edit code, or implement tasks yourself.

**Prompt file rules:**

- Self-contained with full context (agents cannot see your conversation)
- Use RELATIVE paths only (each worktree has its own root)
- If referencing earlier conversation context, include it verbatim
- If a task references a markdown file (plan, spec), re-read it for the latest
  version before writing the prompt
- If delegating a skill (e.g., `/auto`), instruct the agent to use it. Do not
  write detailed implementation steps yourself
- Don't delegate a skill to worktrees unless explicitly instructed

**Spawning workflow: write ALL files first, THEN spawn ALL agents.**

```bash
# Step 1: Write all prompt files (in parallel)
tmpfile_a=$(mktemp).md
cat > "$tmpfile_a" << 'EOF'
Implement auth module...
EOF

tmpfile_b=$(mktemp).md
cat > "$tmpfile_b" << 'EOF'
Write API tests...
EOF

# Step 2: Spawn all agents from topic branch (in parallel, after ALL files exist)
workmux add auth-module -b --base topic/my-feature -P "$tmpfile_a"
workmux add api-tests -b --base topic/my-feature -P "$tmpfile_b"
```

Flags:

- `-b`: background (do not switch to the new window)
- `-P <file>`: prompt file (contents sent to agent on launch)
- `-p <text>`: inline prompt (short tasks only)
- `--name <handle>`: explicit handle name (otherwise derived from branch)
- `--base <branch>`: base branch to branch from (**always specify the topic branch**)

### Monitor Status

```bash
# Table of all active agents
workmux status

# Specific agents only
workmux status auth api-tests
```

### Wait for Status

```bash
# Block until all agents finish
workmux wait agent-a agent-b agent-c

# Wait with timeout (seconds)
workmux wait agent-a --timeout 3600

# Wait for first to finish
workmux wait agent-a agent-b --any

# Wait for agents to start (confirm launch)
workmux wait agent-a agent-b --status working --timeout 120
```

Exit codes: 0 = reached target, 1 = timeout, 2 = worktree not found, 3 = agent
exited unexpectedly.

### Capture Output

```bash
# Read last 200 lines (default)
workmux capture agent-a

# Read last 50 lines
workmux capture agent-a -n 50
```

Output is ANSI-stripped plain text.

### Send Instructions

```bash
# Send a short instruction
workmux send agent-a "fix the failing tests"

# Send a skill command
workmux send agent-a "/commit"

# Send from file (for long prompts)
workmux send agent-a -f followup.md
```

### Run Commands

Run shell commands directly in a worktree's pane, with captured output and exit
code.

```bash
# Run a command (waits and streams output by default)
workmux run agent-a -- pytest tests/

# Run in background (fire and forget)
workmux run agent-a -b -- npm run build

# With timeout (seconds)
workmux run agent-a --timeout 300 -- make test

# Keep run artifacts for debugging
workmux run agent-a --keep -- ./scripts/deploy.sh
```

The command runs in a new split pane. Exit code is propagated (exits 124 on timeout).

### Merge to Topic Branch & Cleanup

Tell the agent to merge its branch into the topic branch via `/merge`. This lets
the agent handle rebasing and conflict resolution.

```bash
# Tell agent to commit, rebase onto topic branch, and merge
workmux send agent-a "/merge"

# Remove a worktree without merging
workmux remove agent-a
```

### Open Unified PR

After all agents are merged into the topic branch, open a single PR:

```bash
# Push topic branch and open PR to main
git switch topic/my-feature
git push origin topic/my-feature
gh pr create --base main --head topic/my-feature \
  --title "feat: my feature" --body "Description of changes"
```

After the PR is merged on GitHub, clean up with:

```bash
# Delete the topic branch locally and remotely
git branch -d topic/my-feature
git push origin --delete topic/my-feature

# Remove worktrees whose remote branch was deleted
workmux remove --gone
```

## Workflow Patterns

### Fan-out / Fan-in

Spawn multiple agents, wait for all, review, merge into topic branch, open PR:

```bash
# 0. Create topic branch
git switch -c topic/my-feature main
git push -u origin topic/my-feature

# 1. Write ALL prompt files first (see "Spawn Agents" above)
# 2. Spawn agents in background (all based on topic branch)
workmux add auth-module -b --base topic/my-feature -P "$tmpfile_auth"
workmux add api-tests -b --base topic/my-feature -P "$tmpfile_tests"
workmux add docs-update -b --base topic/my-feature -P "$tmpfile_docs"

# 3. Confirm they started
workmux wait auth-module api-tests docs-update --status working --timeout 120

# 4. Wait for completion
workmux wait auth-module api-tests docs-update --timeout 7200

# 5. Review results
workmux status
workmux capture auth-module -n 50
workmux capture api-tests -n 50

# 6. Merge into topic branch (one at a time, wait between each)
workmux send auth-module "/merge"
workmux wait auth-module --timeout 120
workmux send api-tests "/merge"
workmux wait api-tests --timeout 120

# 7. Send follow-up if needed
workmux send docs-update "also add the API reference section"
workmux wait docs-update
workmux send docs-update "/merge"
workmux wait docs-update --timeout 120

# 8. Open unified PR from topic branch
git switch topic/my-feature
git push origin topic/my-feature
gh pr create --base main --head topic/my-feature \
  --title "feat: my feature" --body "Description of changes"
```

## Rules

1. **Create a topic branch before spawning agents.** All agents branch from and
   merge back into this topic branch — never into main directly.
2. **Write ALL prompt files before spawning any agents.** Prompts should be
   self-contained with full context. Agents cannot see your conversation.
3. **Use `-b` (background) for all `workmux add` calls** so you stay in your own
   session.
4. **Always specify `--base <topic-branch>`** when spawning agents.
5. **Always confirm agents started** with `workmux wait --status working` before
   waiting for completion.
6. **Capture and review output** before merging. Do not blindly merge.
7. **Merge one at a time** by sending `/merge` to each agent sequentially. Wait
   for each merge to complete before starting the next to avoid conflicts.
8. **Use `--timeout`** to avoid waiting forever. Handle timeout exits
   gracefully.
9. **Prompt files should use relative paths** (each worktree has its own root).
10. You are a coordinator, not an implementer. Never edit source files directly.
11. **Open one unified PR** from the topic branch to main after all agents are
    merged. Do not open per-agent PRs.
